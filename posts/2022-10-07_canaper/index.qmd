## Introducing `canaper`

I am happy to announce that [`canaper`](https://github.com/ropensci/canaper) v1.0.0 is now available on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/canaper/index.html)!
Although I have authored [several R packages](https://www.joelnitta.com/software.html) and made them available via [GitHub](https://github.com/joelnitta/#r-packages-), this is my first original package to be on CRAN.

What is `canaper` you ask?

> `canaper` provides functions to analyze the spatial distribution of
biodiversity, in particular categorical analysis of neo- and paleo-endemism
(CANAPE) as described in Mishler et al (2014) <doi:10.1038/ncomms5473>.
`canaper` conducts statistical tests to determine the types of endemism that
occur in a study area while accounting for the evolutionary relationships of
species.

(from the package [DESCRIPTION](https://github.com/ropensci/canaper/blob/main/DESCRIPTION)).

If that interests you, please read on!

## Phylogenetic endemism and CANAPE

[Biodiversity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodiversity) is often measured by [species richness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species_richness), or counting the number of species in an area.
Likewise, [endemism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemism) is often quantified by the number of species that are completely restricted (endemic) to an area.
However, such purely taxonomic approaches ignore evolutionary history.
Thanks to the widespread availability of molecular [phylogenies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetic_tree), approaches have recently been developed that quantify biodiversity while taking into account the evolutionary history of species.
One such method is **phylogenetic endemism** [PE\; @Rosauer2009], which quantifies endemism based on the range size of **branches of a phylogenetic tree** instead of species.

An advantage of PE is that it provides insight into the **evolutionary processes generating biodiversity**.
For example, areas with high PE and many short branches may be due to recent speciation (radiation) and are termed **neo-endemic**.
In contrast, areas with high PE and many long branches may be due to extinction of previously widespread lineages and are termed **paleo-endemic**.
A method to detect these areas developed by @Mishler2014 is called CANAPE ("**C**ategorical **A**nalysis of **N**eo- and **P**aleo-**E**ndemism").

The goal of `canaper` is to conduct CANAPE in R.

## Example: Australian *Acacia*

`canaper` comes with the same dataset that was analyzed in the original CANAPE paper, a community (species $\times$ sites) matrix and phylogenetic tree of Australian *Acacia*^[*Acacia* is the largest genus of flowering plants in Australia, with nearly 1,000 species] [@Mishler2014].
We will use this for a quick demo^[The settings used here are for demonstration purposes only, and not suitable for a thorough analysis of this dataset].

I won't go into the details here, but you can [read more about this example](https://docs.ropensci.org/canaper/articles/canape.html) on the [`canaper` website](https://docs.ropensci.org/canaper/index.html).

The entire CANAPE workflow can be run with just two commands, [`cpr_rand_test()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/canaper/reference/cpr_rand_test.html) and [`cpr_classify_endem()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/canaper/reference/cpr_classify_endem.html):

```{r}
#| label: acacia-demo
#| warning: false
#| message: false

library(canaper)
library(tidyverse)

# Set a seed for reproducibility
set.seed(12345)

# 1. Run randomization test
acacia_rand_res <- cpr_rand_test(
  acacia$comm, acacia$phy,
  null_model = "curveball",
  n_reps = 99, n_iterations = 10000,
  tbl_out = TRUE
)

# 2. Classify endemism
acacia_canape <- cpr_classify_endem(acacia_rand_res)
```

Let's have a look at some of the output.

[`cpr_rand_test()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/canaper/reference/cpr_rand_test.html) returns a bunch (54 to be exact!) of metrics about each site in the community matrix, including PE:

```{r}
#| label: acacia-rand-res
acacia_rand_res
```

[`cpr_classify_endem()`](https://docs.ropensci.org/canaper/reference/cpr_classify_endem.html) appends another column, `endem_type`, that describes the various endemism types.
Let's count how many of each type was observed:

```{r}
#| label: acacia-endem-res
count(acacia_canape, endem_type)
```

This is what a map of those various endemism types looks like:

```{r}
#| label: acacia-plot
#| code-fold: true

# Fist do some data wrangling to make the results easier to plot
# (add lat/long columns)
acacia_canape <- acacia_canape |>
  separate(site, c("long", "lat"), sep = ":") |>
  mutate(across(c(long, lat), parse_number))

# Tweak the plot theme
theme_update(
  panel.background = element_rect(fill = "white", color = "white"),
  panel.grid.major = element_line(color = "grey60"),
  panel.grid.minor = element_blank()
  )

ggplot(acacia_canape, aes(x = long, y = lat, fill = endem_type)) +
  geom_tile() +
  # cpr_endem_cols_4 is a CVD-friendly color palette in canaper
  scale_fill_manual(values = cpr_endem_cols_4) +
  coord_fixed() +
  guides(
    fill = guide_legend(title.position = "top", label.position = "bottom")
  ) +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom", legend.title = element_blank())
```

## rOpenSci

Another first for me was submitting my package to [rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org/), an organization that [promotes and supports research software written with R](https://ropensci.org/about/).
**I can't recommend rOpenSci highly enough** for anyone interested in publishing their own R package for research.

First, rOpenSci provides [extensive documentation](https://devguide.ropensci.org/) for authoring scientific R packages as well as [automated checks](https://docs.ropensci.org/pkgcheck/).
Just going through this process alone significantly improved my code.

Second, packages submitted to rOpenSci undergo thorough and open [code review](https://devguide.ropensci.org/softwarereviewintro.html), which lead me to [several improvements](https://github.com/ropensci/software-review/issues/475) I would have otherwise never thought of^[Thanks to reviewers [Klaus Schliep](https://github.com/KlausVigo) and [Luis Osorio](https://github.com/luismurao), and editor [Toby Hocking](https://github.com/tdhock)].

Finally, the [rOpenSci community](https://ropensci.org/community/) is highly active and welcoming, with [community calls](https://ropensci.org/commcalls/), [co-working sessions](https://ropensci.org/events/), and a lively Slack workspace.

So please check it out, and a big **thank-you** to rOpenSci!
