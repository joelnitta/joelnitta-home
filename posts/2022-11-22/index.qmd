### Multilingual Quarto websites with PO files

Quarto has [nice support](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/language.html) for specifying the language of various parts of the website text that it generates (e.g., text in the header and footer, etc.).
However, it currently lacks support for switching between multiple languages within a single website, as can be seen from the discussion in [this issue}](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/issues/275).
Maintaining parallel versions of a website in different languages is not a simple task, which explains the variety of approaches people have taken.

Here is a summary my current approach.
You can browse the source code of my webpage for details: https://github.com/joelnitta/joelnitta-home/

Please note I do not think this is optimal, and hope to improve it going forward!
My main reason for writing this blog post to make a record for myself of my current setup and to get feedback.
Please post in the comments if you have ideas!

## PO files

I use PO files for my translation.
PO files have been around for a long time, and were initially used in conjunction with the [gettext](https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/) program to translate messages in the user interface of linux programs.

Why use PO files?

The main benefit is that PO files allow us to break translated strings down line by line.
This way, if there is a change to document in the original language, we know exactly where it occurred and only have to update the translation for that part.

Here is an example of a few lines of PO file from my website:

```
#. type: YAML Front Matter: description
#: /409952fb95fbb825992593fca10961ea_1/index.qmd:1
#, no-wrap
msgid "Announcing the canaper R package!"
msgstr "Rパッケージcanaperの紹介"
```

Without going in to too many details, you can see the original string is in the line starting with `msgid` and the translated string is in the line starting with `msgstr`.
Can you see how this would allow us to track changes line by line?

This isn't so important if your content is never going to change; in that case, you could just write a separate translated document and be done with it.
But websites typically are getting updated on a regular basis, so we want a system that will work well in that context.

## Folder setup

This is a very simplified version of what my Quarto project setup looks like:

```
.gitignore
_site/
_po/
|  |
|  \--ja/
|       |
|       \-- index.po
_locale/
|  |
|  \--ja/
|       |
|       | _site/
|       |
|       \-- index.qmd
|       ...        
index.qmd
...
```

There are of course various other `qmd` files in addition to `index.qmd` that comprise the website.
The main website in the original language is generated using `quarto render`, which outputs to `_site/` as usual.

The important thing to notice is some folders you don't typically see in a Quarto project: `_po/` and `_locale/`.
`_po/` contains the PO files to translate the files in the original language (here, English) to the target language (here, Japanese).
I have [a script](https://github.com/joelnitta/joelnitta-home/blob/a69255850e63cdcd319eb0ff0eee917d4696ce40/R/translate.R) that generates the initial PO files without any strings in the target language yet.
I then translate those myself and save them in the PO file.
Next, [my script](https://github.com/joelnitta/joelnitta-home/blob/a69255850e63cdcd319eb0ff0eee917d4696ce40/R/translate.R) uses the English file (e.g., `index.qmd`) and the PO file [to generate the Japanese version](https://github.com/joelnitta/joelnitta-home/blob/a69255850e63cdcd319eb0ff0eee917d4696ce40/R/translate.R#L32-L62) of `index.qmd`.
The translation is saved in the `_locale/ja` subfolder.
I don't have any other languages yet, but if I did, they would each get their own subfolders in `_po/` and `_locale/`.

So in essence, each language folder in `_locale/` is a replicate of the website in that language.

I can then render the Japanese version of the site by running `quarto render locale/ja`, which will build the site to `_locale/ja/_site`.
Since `_locale` starts with an underscore, contents of that folder are ignored by the main Quarto build in `./_site`.

## Branch setup

So far so good. But how can we deploy this scheme?

I considered two options: tracking the `_locale/` folder in `main` and building the translation from it, or copying the contents of the `_locale/lang` subfolder (the translated website) to the root of a **different branch** then building from that branch.
In the end, I went with the second option.
As I said, I am not convinced this is optimal, but it works.

My main reason for choosing this option is that I could figure out a way to make it work with GitHub (GH) actions.
GH actions can perform routine tasks for us like rendering the site and help us avoid committing "artifacts" that are not integral to the actual code underlying the site.

To enact this two-branch approach, I first add `_locale/` to my `.gitignore`.
Conceptually this makes sense because the files in `_locale/` are all generated **by code** (the PO files); they are outputs, not source code.

Next, I checkout a new branch that I call `ja-source`.
Since `_locale/` is being git-ignored, it doesn't go away when we checkout `ja-source`.
I then recursively copy all files in `_locale/ja` to the project root [using `rsync`](https://github.com/joelnitta/joelnitta-home/blob/a69255850e63cdcd319eb0ff0eee917d4696ce40/R/translate.R#L78-L84).
Now the contents of `ja-source` have all been converted to Japanese, so we can commit the changes and switch back to `main`.

## GitHub Actions workflow

The last part is launching the site using GitHub actions.

I have two yaml workflows, `publish_site_en.yaml` and `publish_site_ja.yaml`, the former is only saved to `.github/workflows` in the `main` branch and the latter only in the `ja-source` branch.

`publish_site_en.yaml` basically looks like the yaml provided by Quarto:

```
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
  push:
    branches: main

name: Quarto Publish EN

jobs:
  build-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: write
    steps:
      - name: Check out repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Set up Quarto
        uses: quarto-dev/quarto-actions/setup@v2
        with:
          version: pre-release

      # install libcurl, needed for curl R package
      - name: Install cURL Headers
        run: |
          sudo apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev

      - name: Install R
        uses: r-lib/actions/setup-r@v2
        with:
          r-version: '4.2.0'

      - name: Install R Dependencies
        uses: r-lib/actions/setup-renv@v2
        with:
          cache-version: 1

      - name: Render and Publish EN
        uses: quarto-dev/quarto-actions/publish@v2
        with:
          target: gh-pages
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

But `publish_ja.yaml` is a bit different:

```
on:
  push:
    branches: ja-source
  pull_request:
    branches: ja-source
  # to be able to trigger a manual build
  workflow_dispatch:

name: Quarto publish JA

jobs:
  build-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: write
    steps:
      - name: Check out repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Set up Quarto
        uses: quarto-dev/quarto-actions/setup@v2
        with:
          version: pre-release

      # install libcurl, needed for curl R package
      - name: Install cURL Headers
        run: |
          sudo apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev

      - name: Install R
        uses: r-lib/actions/setup-r@v2
        with:
          r-version: '4.2.0'

      - name: Install R Dependencies
        uses: r-lib/actions/setup-renv@v2
        with:
          cache-version: 1

      - name: Render Quarto Project
        uses: quarto-dev/quarto-actions/render@v2

      - name: Deploy 🚀
        # don't deploy on PR
        if: github.event_name != 'pull_request'
        uses: JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action@v4
        with:
          # The branch the action should deploy to.
          branch: ja
          # The folder the action should deploy. Adapt if you changed in Quarto config
          folder: _site
```

First, notice the `on:` directive tells it only to run on pushes to `ja-source`, not `main`.

From there it the same until the `deploy` step.

Here, instead of using the standard Quarto action `quarto-dev/quarto-actions/publish`, we use a more generic action, `JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action`.
This action includes the option to specify a particular branch **besides gh-pages** for deployment.
I deploy the rendered site to the `ja` branch (now the choice of `ja-source` for the source code in Japanese makes sense yes?)

And now we have simultaneous deployment of different languages in different branches.

## Netlify

The last part is to make all of this work with my custom domain name, `www.joelnitta.com`.

I am not going to go into so many details here, because I imagine people's approaches to hosting may be more varied.

I use Netlify for managing my domain, and pay for the domain name with GoDaddy.
Within Netlify, I have two websites^[It looks like you could also have a single website with a subdomain building from a specific branch. AFAICT either way should work.].
One has a primary domain of `www.joelnitta.com` (English) and the other has a primary domain of `www.ja.joelnitta.com` (Japanese).

Both websites are configured to deploy from `https://github.com/joelnitta/joelnitta-home`, but the English version deploys from `gh-pages` and the Japanese version deploys from `ja`.

I have a simple button to link between languages on the right hand side of my header.

That's pretty much it.

## Couldn't this be even more streamlined?

So one question you may have is "Why even bother with manually committing to `ja-source`? Couldn't we automate that with GH Actions too?"

My answer is in theory "Yes" and I would like to!
But unfortunately, [my script](https://github.com/joelnitta/joelnitta-home/blob/a69255850e63cdcd319eb0ff0eee917d4696ce40/R/translate.R) for generating the translated files from the PO files is not perfect; the output ends up with some misplaced line breaks that I need to manually correct.

Another wrinkle is that since we are translating at the level of the **source code** (Qmd files), each translated document needs to be rendered to HTML.
This isn't a big deal if you don't have computations, but if computations take some time, you may not want to render everything from scratch each time.

If I can get the `en + PO -> ja` step completely automated, then it should be possible to only have the `_po/` folder in addition to the normal Quarto setup in `main`, then run everything with GH Actions.

Someday it will happen, I hope!
